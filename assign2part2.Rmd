```{r}
load("~/srt123.rdata")
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(data=APIcymon, aes(x=ipNum, y=NumOfSources, group=1)) + geom_point()
p <- p + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
p

## For every IP how many sources report it?
```{r}
mean(APIcymon$NumOfSources)
min(APIcymon$NumOfSources)
max(APIcymon$NumOfSources)
```

## For every IP how many URL's does it have?
```{r}
p <- ggplot(data=APIcymon, aes(x=ipNum, y=NumOfUrls, group=1)) + geom_point()
p
```
As you can see it is mostly 0 or 10 and there are a few outliers
